# Array Normalization in C

## Overview

This C program is designed to handle a 2D array, allowing users to input values, calculate the minimum and maximum values, and normalize the array to a range between 0 and 1. The normalized array is then displayed. This project serves as a basic example of array manipulation and normalization in the C programming language.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting column and row dimensions.
- Dynamic allocation of memory for the 2D array.
- Calculation of minimum and maximum values in the array.
- Normalization of array values to a range between 0 and 1.
- Displaying the final normalized array.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler, such as GCC:

   ```bash
   gcc your_program_name.c -o MatrixNormalization

2. Run the executable:
  
  ```bash
  ./MatrixNormalization
  
3. Follow the prompts to input the number of columns and rows, as well as the individual array values.

4. Observe the program's output, displaying the normalized array.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)

## Example

```bash
Column = 3
Row = 2
input number = 1
input number = 2
input number = 3
input number = 4
input number = 5
input number = 6
0.0000 0.2000 0.4000 
0.6000 0.8000 1.0000
